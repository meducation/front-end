# Contributing to Meducation's Front End Libraries

First of all, **thank you** for contributing to these libraries.

## Issues 
Please file issues on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/meducation/front-end/issues) and give as much detail as possible.

## Features / Pull Requests

If you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a pull request that implements it. Please make sure it has tests. As this library is used primarily for Meducation, there needs to be some value to Meducation for your new feature to be accepted.

Please stick to the [CoffeeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide).

If you've not contributed to a repository before - this is the accepted pattern to use:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

## Setup

Presuming you have npm installed:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt
bundle
```

To run the JavasScript tests, use `grunt test`.
To start a local server, use `grunt server`.

Thank you again!
